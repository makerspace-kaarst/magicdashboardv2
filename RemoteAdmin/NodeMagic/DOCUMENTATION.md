## Upload an image

- To add an image in the "Node Templating Editor", you need to add the desired image in the main menu under "Upload an image" at the bottom left.

  ![Upload an image](img/upload_an_image.png)

- After uploading the image, you can insert the image into a slice using the "Node Templating Editor". To do this, you need a headline and the file name of the image (for example: "img001.png").

***ATTENTION:*** The uploader can only process PNG and JPEG files. Other files will be uploaded, but you cannot use them.
